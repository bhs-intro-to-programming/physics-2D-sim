# physics-2D-sim (WIP)
a 2-dimensional physics simulation wherein you can draw, rotate, apply force to, change the mass of, and have gravity act on flat objects/shapes.

Controls:
 	
	Left Click - places a dot (vertice, vector, or center)
 	
	Space - When dots are placed, draws the shape. Otherwise, starts/pauses the animation and allows/disallows placing dots.
