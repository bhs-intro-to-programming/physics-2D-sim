# physics-2D-sim (WIP)
a 2-dimensional physics simulation wherein you can draw, rotate, apply force to, change the mass of, and have gravity act on flat objects/shapes.

Controls:
 	
	G - opens the config gui to make "perfect" shapes (all sides with same length, all vertices with same angle), 
	change the density, and/or enter circle mode
 	
	Left Click - places a dot (vertice, vector, or center
 	
	Space - When dots are placed, draws the shape. Otherwise, starts/pauses the animation.
